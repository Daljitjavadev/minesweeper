###########################Minesweeper Application â€“ Design and Usage######################

					###### Design Overview######
The application is a console-based Minesweeper game implemented in Java 21.

It follows clean code principles, with a modular design separating the game logic (Board, Cell) from user interaction (Game).

Mines are randomly placed on the board after the first user move, guaranteeing the first selected cell and its neighbors are mine-free.

The game supports customizable grid size (minimum 4x4) and mine count (maximum 35% of total cells minus a safe zone).

User inputs are validated to ensure correct coordinates are entered.

The board reveals adjacent empty cells automatically, mimicking standard Minesweeper behavior.

The game loop continues until the player either uncovers a mine (loses), reveals all safe cells (wins), or chooses to exit.

					######Assumptions######

The game runs in a terminal/command line interface.

The minimum grid size is 4 to allow a safe zone around the first move.

The maximum number of mines is capped at 35% of total cells, adjusted to preserve the safe zone.

User input for moves follows the format <RowLetter><ColumnNumber>, e.g., A1.

The environment running the game has Java 21 installed.

					######Environment######

Developed and tested on Windows OS.

Requires Java 21 or later installed and properly configured in the system PATH.
